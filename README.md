# Watch Together 
# Backstory
Wanted to watch movies/animes with my friends around the 
world together.

However, my internet connection was too laggy, plus I
used to use mobile data. Therefore streaming with discord
or other services would be not feasible.

So, this idea hit me: what if we both have the movie file,
in that case we just have to synchronize the time instead of 
streaming the whole movie!

# Some technical "Insight/Idea"
I usually embed this app as an iframe to my web-chat app
to watch and chat with the friends.

# Installation and Running
Just another simple node/npm app installation. Clone the
repository, cd into it and run
```
npm install 
```
And you are good to go!

Then run `npm start` to run the backend server.


About the front end: Just host the public directory as a
basic http file server.

For example cd into the directory and do:
python -m http.server
